Hello!

I'm a pre-doctoral researcher in the [Machine Learning and Optimization](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/) team at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), Bangalore, India. My primary research interests are devoted towards generative models and foundations of deep learning.

I am currently advised by [Dr. Sujoy Paul](https://sujoyp.github.io/) and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/) on efficient machine learning models, and further collaborate with [Dr. Arun Suggala](https://research.google/people/arun-sai-suggala/) and [Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugam](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/karthikeyan-shanmugam), on establishing stronger theoretical guarantees for Collaborative Bandit approaches. While not in direct pursuit currently, I also maintain a keen interest in the field of Stochastic Optimization, as well as the intersection between Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning.

Prior to this, I spent an year at Microsoft India R&D, working in the Enterprise Commerce team as a Data & Applied Scientist, solving problems in the realm of extreme classification, machine learning of sets and recommender systems. This was directly after my graduation with a Bachelor (with Honors) degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), Mumbai, India, along with minor degrees in Computer Science as well as Machine Intelligence. During my undergrad, my focus was on robotics, including ground and aerial vehicles, especially autonomous driving.

Outside of work, I spend my time playing (:mountain:,:badminton:,:tennis:), traveling, or reading mystery thrillers.
