# <span style="color:#1976d2;">👤 About Me</span>

Hello!  
I'm an **Applied Scientist at Microsoft AI**. Previously, I was a pre-doctoral researcher in the [Machine Learning and Optimization](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/) team at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), Bangalore, India. My primary research interests are in **generative models** and the **foundations of deep learning**.

**At Google DeepMind**, I was advised by [Dr. Sujoy Paul](https://sujoyp.github.io/), [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/), [Dr. Arun Suggala](https://research.google/people/arun-sai-suggala/), and [Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugam](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/karthikeyan-shanmugam), working on efficient machine learning models, reinforcement learning for diffusion models, and theoretical guarantees for collaborative bandit approaches. I also maintain a keen interest in unsupervised post-training for large language models, particularly via reinforcement learning.

Previously, I spent a year at Microsoft India R&D as a Data & Applied Scientist, working on extreme classification, machine learning of sets, and recommender systems. I graduated with a **B.Tech (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering** from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), with minors in Computer Science and Machine Intelligence. During my undergrad, I focused on robotics (ground and aerial vehicles), especially autonomous driving.
