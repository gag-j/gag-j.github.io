Hello :wave:

I'm a pre-doctoral researcher in the [Machine Learning and Optimization](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/) team at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), Bangalore, India. My primary research interests are devoted towards generative models and foundations of deep learning.

<a href="/bio/">Extended Bio</a>
<!-- I am currently advised by [Dr. Sujoy Paul](https://sujoyp.github.io/) and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/) on efficient machine learning models, and further collaborate with [Dr. Arun Suggala](https://research.google/people/arun-sai-suggala/) and [Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugam](https://sites.google.com/corp/view/karthikeyan-shanmugam), on establishing stronger theoretical guarantees for Collaborative Bandit approaches. While not in direct pursuit currently, I maintain a keen interest in the field of Stochastic Optimization, as well as the intersection between Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning. -->
<!-- I strive to build AI technologies that are simultaneously open/accessible to all and safe/ethical.  -->

<!-- Prior to this, I spent an year at Microsoft India R&D, working in the Enterprise Commerce team as a Data & Applied Scientist, solving problems in the realm of extreme classification, machine learning of sets and recommender systems. This was directly after my graduation with a Bachelor (with Honors) degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), Mumbai, India, along with minor degrees in Computer Science as well as Machine Intelligence. During my undergrad, my focus was on robotics, including ground and aerial vehicles, especially autonomous driving. -->

<!-- Outside of work, I spend my time playing (:mountain:,:badminton:,:tennis:), traveling, or reading mystery thrillers. -->
